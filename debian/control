Description: Modern C++ implementation of Japanese morphological analyzer - development files
 Kagome C++ is a modern C++23 implementation of the Japanese morphological
 analyzer kagome, originally written in Go. This implementation uses modern
 C++ features and libraries for high-performance Japanese text tokenization.
 .
 This package contains the development files (headers and static libraries).

Description: Modern C++ implementation of Japanese morphological analyzer - runtime
 Kagome C++ is a modern C++23 implementation of the Japanese morphological
 analyzer kagome, originally written in Go. This implementation uses modern
 C++ features and libraries for high-performance Japanese text tokenization.
 .
 Features:
  * Modern C++23 with concepts, ranges, and format library
  * High performance with efficient hash tables
  * Unicode support with proper UTF-8 handling
  * Multiple tokenization modes (Normal, Search, Extended)
  * Lattice-based analysis using Viterbi algorithm
  * Dictionary support (System and user dictionaries)
  * Memory efficient with object pooling
 .
 This package contains the runtime library.

Description: Japanese tokenizer plugin for Rspamd mail system
 This package provides a shared library plugin for Rspamd mail processing
 system, enabling Japanese text tokenization for spam detection and email
 classification.
 .
 The plugin uses the Kagome C++ library to perform morphological analysis
 of Japanese text, providing better tokenization for Japanese emails than
 standard Unicode word breaking.
 .
 Features:
  * Automatic Japanese text detection
  * High-performance morphological analysis
  * Seamless integration with Rspamd tokenizer framework
  * Configurable confidence thresholds
  * Fallback to default tokenizer for non-Japanese text

Architecture: all
Section: misc
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: IPA dictionary for Kagome Japanese morphological analyzer
 This package contains the IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency)
 dictionary required by the Kagome Japanese morphological analyzer.
 .
 The dictionary provides:
  * Part-of-speech information
  * Reading (pronunciation) data
  * Word segmentation rules
  * Morphological features for Japanese text analysis
 .
 This dictionary is based on the IPAdic dictionary and is required for
 proper operation of the Kagome tokenizer.

Description: Command-line tools for Japanese morphological analysis
 This package provides command-line utilities for Japanese text analysis
 using the Kagome morphological analyzer.
 .
 Included tools:
  * kagome_main - Interactive and batch text analysis
  * kagome_tests - Test suite for validation
 .
 The tools support multiple tokenization modes, JSON output, and lattice
 visualization for detailed morphological analysis debugging.
